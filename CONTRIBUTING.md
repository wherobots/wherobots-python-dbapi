# Contributor Guidance

This project uses `uv`. Run `uv sync` after checking out the repository
to initialize your virtualenv with the project's dependencies.

## Publish package to PyPI

When we are ready to release a new version `vx.y.z`, one of the maintainers should:

1. Execute `uv version {minor,patch}` to update the project version
1. Commit the version change and any release-related changes
1. Create a new tag with `git tag -s -m "Version x.y.z" vx.y.z`.
   If the tag doesn't match with the project version, step 4 validation will fail.
1. Push the tag to the repo with `git push origin vx.y.z`
1. There will be a GitHub Action triggered automatically which will build and publish to PyPI
